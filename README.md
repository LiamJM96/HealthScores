# HealthScores
First attempt at data analysis and visualisation of health data using Python 3 and Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda. Libraries used include Scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, pandas.
The healthscores.csv shows the health score of each patient where a higher health score is better.
The goal was to see which features impact the health score and also try to predict a patient's healthscore using linear regression and random forest regressor.
